TODO: Preferably, don't use this anymore. Use DesktopControlClient and PhoneControlServer instead. It's better and faster, and supports motors.

HOW TO USE THE SERVO TESTING CLASSES!

*The TestServoPos class is used for one servo, the TestTwoServoPos is used for two servos.*

Basics:
As the class name implies, these servo testing classes are used to find servo positions directly from
these two opModes. There are no edits required! No more going back and changing servo positions bit by bit
and uploading repeatedly.

Both of these classes need you to enter the name of the servo using the gamepad. Follow the instructions
below.

I will be discussing the TestServoPos class first:
    1. Use the right and left DPad (arrow keys) to search through the letters of the alphabet
    (you are able to see in the telemetry)
    2. Press B to confirm the letter you're hovering. Use the up and down DPad to turn on/off caps lock.
    A to delete your character.
    3. Continue until you spelt out the entire servo name that's listed in the config. Press OPTION to confirm
    4. Switch to gamepad two. Here, you will be able to actually test the servo
    5. Use right and left DPad to increase/decrease the servo position (shown in the telemetry).
    6. Use the up and down DPad to increase/decrease the increment value (shown in the telemetry).
    7. Once you find the servo position you want, you're done! :D

For the second class, you're able to control 2 servos at the same time. The controls are mostly the same.
    1. Instead of filling in the name for one servo, you need to do it with two. Use Y to
    switch the current servo.
    2. Once you successfully put in the names, switch to gamepad two to find the servo positions.
    3. The buttons A and B are now available to you. Press it to move both servos at the same
    time forwards/backwards.

That's it! Thanks for reading.
